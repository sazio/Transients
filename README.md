## Intro

Computing with a dynamical system implies that this system changes its behavior depending on the quality and quantity of the incoming information. It is an enormous field, *Rabinovich et al.* focused they attention on the concept of Winnerless Competition (WLC). WLC itself has been observed in many experiments in hydrodinamics (*Kuppers-Lortz instability* for a large Prandtle number), population biology (*May & Leonard, 1975*) etc.. 

This process can be described by Lotka-Volterra equations (there's a direct connection between Generalized Lotka-Volterra and Rate Models in Neuroscience, see *Rabinovich et al. 2006*), that are well known in population biology and can explain the competition among three species:
